    <p>The results from these test's don’t really affect my thoughts about myself very much. I have taken the Enneagram test multiple times and although my results come back some-what the same each time they do vary depending on my mood. I believe that the results from these tests can give you a rough guide as to what type of person you may be whilst taking the test but I wouldn't hard-code myself as a certain personality type.  </p>
    <p>I believe that these results may make you strive to fit the personality type assigned to you when working in a group. In a group I feel that the enneagram test will be most useful to look at, this will guide you as to what role you would best play when working in a team. </p>
    <p>When forming a group, it would be a good idea to have people will all different personality types, this way you can all use each other’s strengths to progress your project or whatever you are aiming to accomplish as a team. It would be unwise to have a team where everybody has the same personality type, if this was the case and everybody had the traits to become a leader for example, then I would expect there to be many unnecessary clashes. The best teams have a variety of different personality traits all working together to bring the best out in each other.</p>
