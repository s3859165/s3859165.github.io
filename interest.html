        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

        <p>I have always been interested in computers and IT, mainly through playing video games from a young age. When I was younger I never realised there was much opportunity for a career in IT but as I got older and technology developed I realised that I had the opportunity to learn about IT and could potentially make a career in the field. Until about 3 years ago I was still unsure as to what I would find passion in work-wise until the partner or my manager at the time showed me what he did for work; (web-development). This sparked my interest in the field and I then enrolled in a Cert IV in Cyber Security and IT.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of my Cert IV’s I was looking at which Universities to apply to, I am not from Australia so I didn’t really know what Universities were good but I have known a lot of people that have studied at RMIT and thoroughly enjoyed it so I thought I would make it my goal to get into the University.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn a lot of the basics in various realms of IT, from programming to user-design. I am still very unsure as to which avenue I would like to take when it comes to which subjects to study later on in the course but I have a feeling I would be interested in the Security/Cloud Computing subjects.</p>
