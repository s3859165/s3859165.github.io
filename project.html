        <h1>Project Idea</h1>

        <p>I would be interested in creating a website similar to hack-the-box. This website hosts many pen-testing labs which offers a platform for anybody wanting to learn and practice their pen-testing skills online. It would be preferable to have the website be free to access for those wanting to learn. When it comes to warfare many countries are steering away from traditional forms of physical combat and instead taking their attacks into the Cyberspace. Cyber warfare is a way for countries to attack each other without having to physically step into the other country, to stop these attacks from happening you will have to have people who know how to attack in order to defend your countries systems.</p>
        <p>The main feature of this website will be to offer live labs on different ways to hack/pen-test. It would almost be like a game where you complete previous levels to advance further and to increase your knowledge in the hacking space. It would start off with an introductory level that the majority of people interested in learning to hack could find their way through with a bit of research and time. This way would integrate the idea of study and gaming to keep students entertained and getting a sense of achievement when completing a level.<br>   I would like this website to offer many different labs for customers to take part in, these would test their different skills when it comes to pen-testing. It would be nice to have hiscores/leaderboards on this website also, just for bragging rights not for any monetary rewards. I would like to have a time-based leaderboards for each lab, this would drive competition to see who could complete new labs the fastest. It would be good for the website to have a separate highscores for schools and universities, this way schools and universities can compete against each other and use the website as a free source for students to do some extra studies outside of the classroom.<br>    Another feature I would like to see on this website is a forum to post for job opportunities/a recruitment page, this would give the employer the chance to look at what sort of pen-testing techniques the applicant is already confident with, if this website became a market leader it would be one of the best places to find confident and experienced hackers.<br>   The issues I would have with the creation of this website would be that there are already some amazing websites that offer this sort of experience already and to break into this space would be very difficult but not impossible. </p>
        <p>We would need a server to run this website, the needs of this depends on the amount of traffic the website would receive but I would assume that if the website was extremely popular a server room would be needed. The website will need very strong anti-DDoS protection as well because I would expect the website to be attacked very often by DDoS attacks. The website will need to be backed up fairly often in case of the site crashing or files becoming corrupted, I would assume that a back-up server would be one of many precautions taken to keep the website running. </p>
        <p>I do not think it would be very hard to set up a basic level of this website, the problem comes when you want to expand the website and create more labs. To start off with you would need a web developer to create your website and somebody to write up the first few labs. This could of course be the same person if you know how to do both these jobs. Once this is done, you can buy a domain to host your website and run it off your home computer to start. After this initial set-up the website can be taken in any direction necessary. </p>
        <p>If this project is successful it would be a world leader in pen-testing websites offering knowledge and hands-on training for many students and avid hackers. The website would hopefully be highly regarded by businesses wanting to hire pen-testers and they would use the websites forum/highscores to contact people for positions in their business.<br>I don’t believe the original problem (Cyber Warfare and rogue hacking groups, hacking for profit) can ever be ‘solved’, it is a fact that there are hackers out there that are willing to do extreme damage to benefit themselves. The only way to limit these 'black hat' hacker’s ability to complete their tasks is to train 'white hat' hackers to make systems more difficult to penetrate.</p>
