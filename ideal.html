        <p>This position is for a senior penetration tester/ethical hacker. This field appeals to me so much because there is a large amount of problem solving/out of the box thinking that goes into getting the job done. The fact that this role is a senior role means you will have to lead/train staff and I really enjoy social interaction and helping others develop their skills.</p>
        <p>Requirements to be considered for this role are fairly high (I would definitely not get a reply if I applied right now or even if I were to apply after finishing my degree). A requirement for this role is a Bachelor Degree in the relevant field and 4 years of Cyber Security experience along with a number of other Certifications. The applicant is also required to be proficient in many programming languages, penetration software’s and operating systems. </p>
        <p>Currently I would consider myself a novice when it comes to my skills, qualifications and experience in IT. My qualifications are currently two Certificate IV’s; one in Cyber Security and the other in Information Technology, I also have a Microsoft Certificate in Systems Administration. During my studies I learnt a bit about networking, system administration, some programming using python and a bit of web-design using HTML & CSS.</p>
        <p>To obtain the skills, qualifications and experience to be able to apply for this position will take me many years of learning and working in the field. I plan to finish my University studies in IT and in my summer breaks hopefully complete some of the required certificates. After my studies I will look to get a job in the field to help me develop my skills in the workplace, I am sure I will learn a lot from any senior members of staff that I work with in the future and I look forward to this.</p>
